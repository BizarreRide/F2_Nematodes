Aims of the Analysis:
*********************

The first and foremost aim is:

1. Are there typical community structures dependent on the age_classes (or other parameters)???

  How could that be adressed?
  1.1 By multivariate multiple Regression
  
  1.2 By RDA() Analysis
  
  1.3 By NMDS() Analysis


2. Are there Indicator families, typical for the communities of the age_classes?

  How could that be adressed?
  2.1 ISA using method Indval
  
  2.2 Multivariate Regression tree (MRT)??


## Notes: These tests are possible with both, the repeated measures data, or the pooled data. 
Data can be pooled by either: differences or means.
The species data can also be reduced, when very rare speies were not taken into acccount.



3. If age_class is a good environmental predictor, Does the repeated measurements have an Influence already?
    ** Is the effect of age_class resembled during the time of sampling **

  How could that be adresses?
  3.1 See if the interaction of age class and sampling campaign has an significant influence
      **Is it necessary here to account for within subject correlation?**
  
  3.2 See if "age" as a variable is influencial, 
      **however this approach is probably not taking correlation between samples from the same field into account**
  
  3.2 Comparing the two data sets, by using methods 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 for each in turn
  
  3.3 pairwise comparisons of sampling pairs

4. If age_class is not a good explanation, are there structures, tha can be explained by other factors?

  How could that be adressed?
  3.1 CLustering the family composition data
