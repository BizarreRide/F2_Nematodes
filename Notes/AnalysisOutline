Aims of the Analysis:

The first anf foremost aim is:
X1. Are there typical community structures for the age_classes???

How could that be adressed?
1.1 By multivariate multiple Regression

1.2 By RDA() Analysis

1.3 By NMDS() Analysis

2. Are there Indicator families, typical for the communities of the age_classes?

How could that be adressed?
2.1 ISA using method Indval

2.2 Multivariate Regression tree (MRT)??

X2. If age_class is a good environmental predictor, Does the repeated measurements have an Influence already?
    ** Is the effect of age_class resembled during the time of sampling **

How could that be adresses?
1.1 See if the interaction of age class and sampling campaign has an significant influence
    **Is it necessary here ot account for within subject correlation?**

1.2 See if "age" as a variable is influencial, 
    **however this approach is probably not taking correlation between samples from the same field into account**

1.2 Comparing the two data sets, by using methods 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 for each in turn

1.3 pairwise comparisons of sampling pairs

X3. If age_class is not a good explanation, are there structures, tha can be explaines by other factors?

How could that be adressed?
3.1 CLustering the family composition data
